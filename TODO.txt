This is a list of things to do for FBoH.

Just because an item appears on this list does not guarantee it will be done.

Bug Fixes:

* Fix UI when "too many" tabs are attached to one window
* Timestamp on stacks gets updated when stack size changes. Is this what we want?

* Bag compression (a la Baggins)
* View items worn (done for alts)
* ClosetGnome filter
* ButtonFacade support
* Mailbox tracking
* AutoBar support
* Turn hooking on and off
* Filter for "not in other bag"
* Copy view
* "subtabs" for tabs
